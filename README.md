Current Strategy
Currently for 1-90DPD EOT accounts, dialer and manual calls are separated:
Dialer calls:
1-14 DPD: Excluded from dialer calls
15-60 DPD: Holdout one day after every two days of call
61-80 DPD: Called every day
81-90 DPD: Selected days to call (83, 85, 86, 88, 90DPD)
Manual calls:
No holdout strategy except for accounts promise and/or curtesy holds

Manual calls will be integrated to dialer and workload expected to increase when market back to normal
Servicing will move manual calls to dialer
EOT workload expected to increase when market backs to normal as less people will choose lease buyout

Project Scope:
Design a customized strategy that integrates dialer and manual calls based on accountâ€™s payment propensity, deficiency balance and days past due to further reduce workload
