Hi Team,

As we discussed in the meeting, after implementing the new workable logic provided by Servicing Analytics on Friday, we observed a significant workload reduction (35-42%)—considerably higher than our initial target of 20%.

Here is a timeline of the workable logic validation and update process:

October 1: DS collaborated with Servicing Analytics and Staffing to start workload validation.
October 11: Confirmation of logic and account generation received from Servicing Analytics.
October 18: Additional confirmation received from Staffing.
October 30: Dalton’s simulation results indicated DS workload was higher than BAU, identifying a starting point mismatch as the root cause.
November 1: Dalton shared the updated logic to reconcile the starting point, and recent results over the past two days reflect this adjustment.
I recommend that the team revisits the starting point to ensure alignment with Staffing’s calculations. Since the new logic is yielding a workload reduction above the 20% target, DS will need some time to adjust our strategy accordingly. Assuming this new logic is correct, we expect to require 1-2 weeks to refine and validate the updated strategy through additional simulations.

Thank you for your collaboration.

Best regards,
