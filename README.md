"Hi Quetzal,

Thank you very much for providing the draft letter! I have shared it with the person at Citi who provided the initial signature and requested a new one. I should be able to provide you with the updated letter early next week.

Additionally, I wanted to inform you that I will be traveling to China for three weeks from April 22nd to May 10th. Is there anything I need to pay attention to regarding my immigration status? Currently, I am on an H1B visa with a pending PERM. I obtained an H1B stamp last year in Beijing, China, which is valid until August 2024.

Thanks, Bowen
