Hello Yesenia, 

I hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving! Per our conversation, I have some inquiries about the National Interest Waiver (NIW) visa. Aimee helped file my PERM under regular EB-2 this July. Given the reportedly high approval rates and greater benefits of NIW, could GMF also support me in preparing for this application?

If you have any questions or need anything else, feel free to let me know. Appreciate your help as always!
