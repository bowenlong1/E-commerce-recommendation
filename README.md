Hi Amy, I found this slides presented in the previous executive meeting in Q1 2021, so the original goal of the experiment is to offer repo customer that don’t choose reinstatement, rewrite – as the second option. We learned that:
1.	Reinstatement is high in the experiment period, proactively push rewrites will be disadvantageious
2.	Eventhough every day there are hundred of customer eligible for rewrites, but we have difficuities reaching out to them once they are repo secured
