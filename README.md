Good afternoon Carolina,

I received your contact information from Ateeb and would like to inquire about the CO_TRENDS_BASE_POST_ tables in the sandbox.

Could you please provide clarification on how to interpret the following three columns and their corresponding signs (negative or positive) in the table: CO_DOLLARS, REC_DOLLARS, and TOTL_CHRG_OFF_AMT?

Additionally, I am curious if there is a field in this table that allows for the identification of the net loss for each account. If not available in this table, could you direct me to where I can find this information?

Thank you for your assistance.
