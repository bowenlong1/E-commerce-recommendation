Hi Bowen,

I discussed with the law firm, and they mentioned the NIW would benefit cases that don’t have a PERM filed yet. In your case if they were to confirm you’re eligible and we start a NIW case we would start the green card timeline from scratch. Since your PERM was already filed in July it wouldn’t make sense to reset the clock for your case. 

Please let me know if you have any questions. 

Thank you,
