Hi Anil,

After adding the CURR_RECRD_IND=’Y’ filter, the results now match for the three fields: TERM_PROCESS_DAY_KEY, HLD_DT_IND, and BKRPT_STATUS_CD. So, we only need to debug the prop_tax_due issue for the 90 accounts. I have created a bug item from the Azure dashboard for this.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you.
