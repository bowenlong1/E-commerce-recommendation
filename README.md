From the table MART_FINC.FINCL_TRANSACT_ITM_FACT you provided, I see the waived amounts for each fee type. Is there a source showing the original total fee for each type within the account payoff amount, broken down by fee types?

Also, does "waive" mean the fee is reduced to $0? For instance, if a customer has a $100 waiver for "LATE CHARGES FEE," is that the original fee or has it been completely offset?
