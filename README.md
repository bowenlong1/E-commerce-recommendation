"Thanks, Vivek.

We are good for skip count testing before deployment, but we will conduct it on our end after deployment for at least a week, provided we receive the daily logs from you.

Also, as per our discussion, if we let the first iteration run and simply activate sending communications, it should automatically pick up our new audience list and send customer emails/push notifications while providing us with the logs. If thatâ€™s the case, we can let the first iteration run and activate sending communications."
