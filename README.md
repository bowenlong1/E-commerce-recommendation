Hey Iris, hope you are doing great! I have a update to share with you, I have resigned from my current role at GMF, and my last day is this Friday. I am grateful have you as mentor this year, which definitely make my 5-year experience at GMF even more unfortetable and colorful. Your exsusima and career/life advice will be grateful for me, as I carry forward. I will be moving to San Diego next, I wish you all the best,letâ€™s keep in touch!

Best,
Bowen
