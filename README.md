Hi Ruofan,

I hope this email finds you well. Following our meeting, I'm sharing the resources we discussed:

2nd Iteration Data Pipeline and Databricks Codes:

SAS code for the 2nd iteration data pipeline: "dst_4660dpd_TRIAD_v2.sas."
Databricks links:
Databricks Data & Scoring Pipeline for 1st Iteration
Day2 Email Pipeline for 1st Iteration
Databricks Code for 2nd Iteration
2nd Iteration Strategy Design and 3-day Holdout Monitoring:

"2nd strategy design.xlsx" contains the design for the 2nd iteration strategy, focusing on the 10% target (~27% workable holdout). Refer to "2nd strategy design V2.sas" for the SAS code.
Draft pipeline for 3-day holdout monitoring: "3-day holdout monitor pipeline.sas."
Codes for repeatdq and 2nd Iteration Model Performance Analysis:

Check the highlighted tabs in "Copy of Copy of dq examples.xlsx" workbook for repeated and model performance analysis.
Corresponding SAS codes:
"545 repeatdq and 46+.sas"
"2nd model performance.sas."
46-60DPD Workable Accounts Pull:

"4660 iter2 pull-p4.sas" for model training and strategy design period (before February).
"workable account pipeline.sas" for after the 3-day holdout deployment period (after February).
Additionally, here are the sharedrive folders for 46-60DPD 1st and 2nd iteration.

Please let me know if you need further assistance.

Best regards,
