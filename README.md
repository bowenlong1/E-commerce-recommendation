Subject: Correction for Chinese New Year Date

Hello,

I noticed an error in the Events section on thehub homepage. It states that Chinese New Year is on January 25, but for 2024, it is on February 10. Please make the necessary correction. I appreciate your understanding and support for the Chinese community.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
