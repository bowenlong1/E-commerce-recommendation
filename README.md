Hi Anil,

After adding the CURR_RECRD_IND=’Y’ filter, the results now match for those 3 fields TERM_PROCESS_DAY_KEY, HLD_DT_IND, BKRPT_STATUS_CD. So we only need to debug the prop_tax_due issue for the 90 accounts as for now, I created a bug item from Azure dashbobard

Please let me know if you have any any questions.
