Hi Ashley,

I just forwarded you an email documenting the discussion we had with Servicing about the strategy updates.

In summary, based on simulation results, we identified issues with the starting point logic that Servicing Analytics previously shared with DS. We then received updated logic for the starting point from Servicing. When applying the existing DS strategy to this new logic, it resulted in a workload reduction above the 20% target. This requires DS to make corresponding adjustments to align with the 20% workload reduction target.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
