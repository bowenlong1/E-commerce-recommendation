Hi Jack, thanks for the messages and introduction about ClearML. Currently, our data science department are using Azure Databricks, I don't think we have additional need for other machine learning tools at the moment. Also, I also don't have the authority to sign a contract with another vendor for the whole team. Thanks, Bowen
