Hello Bowen,

The National Interest Waiver (NIW) is a waiver of the PERM labor certification on the basis that the work you are doing is national in scope and has a direct benefit to a specific national interest of the United States. If you are working on projects that are of significance to the interests of the U.S. on a national scale, beyond just the benefit of GMF, then the NIW might be a potential option. Can you please confirm if you are working on projects of significance to the interests of the U.S. on a national scale, beyond just the benefit of GMF?

Please let me know if you have any questions. 

Thank you,
