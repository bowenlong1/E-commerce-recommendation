Good afternoon Aimee,

Happy Friday! I hope this email finds you well. Thank you again for your assistance with my PERM case.

I wanted to inform you that I will be traveling to China for three weeks from April 22nd to May 10th. Could you please advise if there's anything I need to pay attention to regarding my immigration status? Currently, I am on an H1B visa with a pending PERM. I obtained an H1B stamp last year in Beijing, China, which is valid until August 2024.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Bowen
