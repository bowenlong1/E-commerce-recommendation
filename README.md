Data Science tested multiple contact strategies for 46-60 days past due (DPD) accounts aiming to reduce workload while maintaining the same collection performance
•	Serving designed a 3-day dialer holdout strategy based on DPD
•	Data Science designed two omni channel contact strategies, based on payment propensity (machine learning algorithms), estimated equity risks, and DPD

Overall, 3-day dialer holdout strategy show higher percentage of 46DPD vintages moving to 61+DPD than two data science strategies, however, when minimal differences in moving to 91/121+DPD or repo/skip charge-offs

When breakdown results by segment,
•	In high propensity to pay and medium propensity to pay with high equity risk groups, data science strategies have less moving to 61/91/121+DPD & Charge-offs than 3-day holdout, suggesting potentially increased Call Holdout
•	In medium propensity to pay with low equity risk group, data science strategies have more moving to 61+DPD but less to 91/121+DPD & Charge-offs than 3-day holdout, suggesting potentially similar Call Holdout schedule
•	In low propensity to pay group, data science strategies have more moving to 61/ 91/121+DPD & Charge-offs than 3-day holdout, suggesting potentially decreased Call Holdout schedule
