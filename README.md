Hi Quetzal,

Thank you for the update. I haven't received any other letters. Regarding the second requirement concerning the "identification of business issues," I think the second point in my Citi letter addresses it, albeit not in the exact same phrasing. As for the aspects not covered in the first requirement, I interpret them as instances of 'applied methodologies'. If the fourth point in my Citi letter sufficiently addresses 'applied methodologies', I think it should suffice. Or do we need to replicate the precise language from the letters as per the PERM requirements and encompass every example? If that's the case, I can revise the Citi letter to align more closely and obtain the necessary signature. Would that be acceptable?

Best regards,
