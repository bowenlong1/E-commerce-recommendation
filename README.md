Experiment Launch
•	Design:
o	Two DS Strategies: 25% each
o	Control Group: 50%
•	Launch Date: December 6th
•	Additional Treatment Group: Consider adding Servicing Analytics’ holdout proposal (based on days past due).
Monitoring Post-Deployment
•	Use FilePen data to monitor actual workload reduction.
•	Follow the same approach as in previous experiments.
Future Prior-Deployment Validation Process
•	Collaborate with Servicing Analytics and Staffing teams to develop a comprehensive validation process.
•	DS is exploring additional methods, such as bypass triad logic, to validate EOT workload reduction numbers before deployment.
o	Address mismatches, e.g., 122 extra accounts in coded logic (not in BAU) and 93 accounts in BAU (missing from coded logic).
•	Apply the finalized process to future experiments.
