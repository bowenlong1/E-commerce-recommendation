Hi Dalton,

Thanks for sharing the latest simulation results. I believe there's a caveat regarding the calculation of workload reduction. Our goal is a 20% “workload reduction” within the DS accounts group, rather than viewing it as a 120% “holdout increase” in the DS group. Conceptually, the denominator should be the workload in each group, with the expectation that this number will be lower than that of the BAU group.

For example, in today’s results, when we use workload as the denominator, the DS group shows a 19.5% reduction compared to the BAU group.

Thanks again for the update—happy to discuss further if needed.
