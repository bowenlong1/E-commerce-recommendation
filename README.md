Good afternoon Carolina,

I received your contact from Ateeb, and would like to ask you some questions about the CO_TRENDS_BASE_POST_ tables in sandbox. 

How do I interepret these 3 columns in the table, CO_DOLLARS, REC_DOLLARS, TOTL_CHRG_OFF_AMT?



Is there any field in this table I can identify the net loss for each account? If not from this table, where can I find this information?
