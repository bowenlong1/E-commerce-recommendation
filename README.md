Good morning Erwin/Mani,

Please see attached the updated eot pipeline SAS code, the difference of this version is at the end of end, I combined all variabels and generate final output ‘fnl’ table. So as we discussed, it doesn’t impact the intermediate validation steps that Erwin is doing. please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Bowen
