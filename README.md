Hey Dalton, Thanks for sharing the latest simulation results. I think there is a caveat in calculating the workload reduction, our target is 20% workload “reduction” in DS accounts group, instead of 120% more workload “holdout” in DS holdout group, so the denominator thereotically should be the workload in each group, and we expect this number smaller then that of BAU. For example, in today, results, if we use workload as denominator, the results is below, we see DS group has 19.5% less (reduction) compared with BAU group.
