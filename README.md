Morning Yesenia! Appreicate your help helping me consulting the law firm and leadship about NIW, although GMF couldnâ€™t support me at this time, I decided to prepare myself for it. By the way, since I have both several years of working experience and some research projects, do you suggest I need to emphasize more my working experience or research or maybe both to support my NIW application? Or any resources you suggested for me to apply NIW?
