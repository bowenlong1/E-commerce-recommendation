Hi Quetzal,

I hope you are doing well. I recently noticed that my PERM has been certified, and given the current immigration uncertainties, I would like to start the I-140 filing process as soon as possible.

Please let me know if there are any steps I need to take or documents you require from me to move forward. I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.

Thank you, and I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
