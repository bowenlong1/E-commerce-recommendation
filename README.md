Thanks Vivek. We are good skip count testing before deployment, but we will do that on our end after deployment for at least a week as long as we receive the daily logs from you.

Also, per our discssion, if we let the first iteration running and just turn on sending communications, it should automatically pick up our new audience list and send customer email/pushes and give us the logs. If thatâ€™s the case, we can just let the first iteration running and turn on the turn on sending communications.
