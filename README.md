Hi Iris,

Happy Womenâ€™s Day! I wanted to express my heartfelt gratitude for your dedicated time during our mentoring sessions. I've truly valued our discussions on our working situations, mock interviews, career tips, and more. Your insights and advice have been incredibly valuable to me, and I believe they will positively impact both my professional and personal growth.

I am looking forward to continuing our mentoring journey together. Enjoy the holiday and have a fantastic weekend!

Best regards,

Bowen
