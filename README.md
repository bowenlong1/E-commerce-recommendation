Thank you again for the insightful interview session we had recently. Your willingness to share your career experiences and life advice was truly appreciated, and I believe it will have a positive impact not only on my career but also on various aspects of my life.
For our upcoming session, I've allocated slightly less time than usual to follow up on our previous discussions about working situations. However, if there are additional topics you'd like to explore or discuss further, please feel free to let me know.
Thank you once again for your time and valuable insights.
Best regards, 
Bowen
