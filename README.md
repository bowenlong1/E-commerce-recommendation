
Hi Yesenia,

Thanks a lot for looking into the NIW option with the law firm. I wanted to give you a bit more context on why considering it alongside the PERM might be beneficial:

I spoke with my immigration attorney, and the good news is that I don't need to withdraw the PERM application to file for the NIW. They can coexist without affecting each other's progress, so no need to reset the green card process.

Moreover, the PERM process currently takes over 11 months, and there's always a chance of denial. On the other hand, the NIW allows for a more direct filing of the I-140 without going through extensive labor tests, potentially speeding up the overall processing time.

In the ever-changing landscape of immigration processes, having both the NIW and PERM in play acts as a safety net, offering a more secure and flexible route to the green card. This, in turn, allows me to maintain my status and continue contributing to GMF without interruption.

I'd be happy to discuss this further if you have any questions or concerns. Appreciate your time and consideration.

Best,
Bowen
