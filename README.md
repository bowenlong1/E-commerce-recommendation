Hi Iris,
It was really nice to have second mentoring session with you. Thank you for sharing the great suggesions on guiding and work the junior analyst in my team, that’s was really helpful. As we discussed, for this new session, I scheduled a little bit earlier to be this Friday to catch up our interview discussions. Here's a list of questions I've prepared for our discussion:
 
•              Tell me about a time when you were given a substantial workload with a tight deadline, and how you managed your tasks effectively.
•              Share with me a significant professional setback you've encountered and how you navigated through it.
•              Tell me about a time when you had to change direction midway through a project based on receiving or finding new information.
•              Reflect on a time when you found yourself in disagreement with your manager on a matter crucial to the business.
•              Tell me about a time when you received critical feedback from someone.
Tell me about a time when you made an important business decision without consulting your manager

Please let me know if you have any questions Looking forward to our discussion and learning from your experiences.

Thanks,
Bowen
