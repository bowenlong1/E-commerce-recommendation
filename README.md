Hi Team,
Please find the updated deck attached. As discussed in yesterday's meeting, we’ve revised the workload reduction calculation for the manual part based on your feedback. The total estimated reduction in both dialer and manual workload is now about 20%, using Servicing Analytics’ simulations for dialer data and FilePen data for manual workload. This is the most accurate estimate we can provide at this time. Please let us know if you have any feedback.
For the next steps, we propose launching the experiment with two DS strategies (25% each) and a 50% control group on December 6th. We’re also open to including Servicing Analytics’ holdout proposal, based on days past due, as an additional treatment group. After deployment, we’ll continue monitoring the actual workload reduction using FilePen data, as we’ve done in previous experiments.
Regarding validation for future experiments, we agree on the need for a more comprehensive process to ensure thorough checks before deployment. This will require close collaboration across DS, Servicing Analytics, and Staffing teams. DS is already exploring additional methods to validate prior-deployment EOT workload reduction numbers, such as using the bypass triad logic developed earlier. However, as presented, there were mismatches—for instance, on 9/4 workload data, 122 extra accounts appeared in the coded logic but not in BAU, while 93 accounts were in BAU but missing from the coded logic. We’ll share updates as we refine this process. A more comprehensive prior-deployment validation process takes time but once it is finalized, it can also be applied to other experiments.
