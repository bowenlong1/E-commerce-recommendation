Dear my GMF friends,
As you may know, today is my last day with the company. Over the past 5 years in Data Science, it has been an incredible journey. GMF has been the cornerstone of my career, where I have grown, learned, and built friendships that I will cherish for a lifetime.
I deeply appreciate the time we spent working together. Thank you for your guidance, support, and collaborationâ€”this experience is a lifelong asset that I will carry forward.
I am relocating to California for my next chapter and am excited about the opportunities ahead. Wishing you all continued success and a warm, wonderful holiday season for you and your families. Please feel free to keep in touch!
You can reach me at swjtu.bowenlong@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn: Bowen Long.
Warm regards,
Bowen
