Hi Team,
As we discussed in the meeting, after running new workable logic, which we received from servicing analytics on Friday. we observe the current workload reduction percentage (35% ~ 42%) much higher then we planed – 20%. 
DS workload reduction strategy was deployed on the previous logic from servicing analytics, we have been validated this logic and accounts generated since beginning of October (10/1), and received confirmation from servicing analytics (10/11) and staffing (10/18) by mid october. However, on 10/30, we received simulation results from Dalton pointing out the issue ds workload is higher than bau, we identified the root cause for this issue is go back to starting point – workable logic mismatch, and then Dalton shared us the new logic to reconcile the starting point on Nov 1st, and generated the latest two days results as we discussed in the meeting.

I would encourage team to revisit the starting point, make sure it’s reconcile with staffing team’s calculation. since our strategy applied on the new logic higher than 20% target, for ds we need time to modify the strategy given the new workable logic, assuming the current workale logic is totally fine, we expect to have 1-2 weeks to refine and validate the new strategy with simulation results.
