Hi Iris,
It was really nice to have the first session with to know more about each other and discuss our mentoring plan. Thank you for sharing all those great tips to improve the leadership skills! I like your idea bring another mentee in some sessions to share with each other! Also as discussed, I will think about ideas myself how we can conduct productive mentoring sessions and let you you knowÔºÅI am looking forward our next session.

Best,
Bowen
