Experiment Deployment
Design:
Treatment Group: Two DS Strategies, 25% each
Control Group: 50%
Target Launch Date:  December 6th
Additional Treatment Group: Consider adding Servicing Analytics’ holdout proposal (based on days past due)

Monitoring Post-Deployment
Use FilePen data to closely monitor actual workload reduction
Track cohorts moving to different delinquency buckets such 5/31/61/91+DPD as well as track recoveries and changes in deficiency balances

Future Prior-Deployment Validation Process
Collaborate with Servicing Analytics and Staffing teams to develop a comprehensive validation process 
DS is exploring additional methods, such as using bypass triad logic to validate EOT workload reduction numbers before deployment
Address mismatches, e.g., 122 extra accounts in coded logic (not in BAU) and 93 accounts in BAU (missing from coded logic)
Apply the finalized process to future experiments
