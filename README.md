Hi Iris,

Thank you so much for sharing the job description. Since my career experiences so far have primarily focused on data sciences with minimal exposure to F&I training and working with dealers, for interview practice purposes, I anticipate challenges in relating relevant experiences to this position. I do appreciate you providing me this great real interview opportunity for practice though.

Regarding the alternative approach we discussed earlier, I can compile a list of questions beforehand, and you can ask me about them during our mentoring sessions, similar to the interview format I used with you. While it may not replicate real interviews where questions are unknown in advance, I believe this method will still be beneficial. First, it will help me articulate my experiences confidently. Second, your follow-up questions and advice based on my answers will not only improve my interview skills but also help me consider ways to enhance my performance in real work scenarios. If you agree with this approach, we can incorporate it into our future mentoring sessions. Of course, if you're not comfortable with this idea, we can explore other options.

Once again, thank you for the invaluable mentoring sessions. Please let me know if you have any questions. I'm looking forward to our next session!

Best regards, 
Bowen
