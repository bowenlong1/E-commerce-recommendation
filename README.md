Hi Ashley,
I just forwared you an email documenting the discussion we had with servicing about strategy updates. In summary, based on simulation results, we identified issues with starting point logic servicing analytics shared before with DS, and then we received a updated logic for the starting point from servicing, applying existing DS strategy, it holdout more then 20% workload reduction target.  hich require DS to make corresponding changes to reflect the 20% target workload reduction,
