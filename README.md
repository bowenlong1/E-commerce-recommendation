Hi Quetzal,

Just a quick heads up about my upcoming travelâ€”I'll be in China for three weeks starting next Monday. During this time, I may not have access to my company email.

If any immigration matters arise that require immediate attention, please contact me via my personal email address at swjtu.bowenlong@gmail.com or by reaching out to my mobile phone at 732-5797-255.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
