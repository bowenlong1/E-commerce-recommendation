Hi Team,
As we discussed in the meeting, after implementing the new workable logic provided by Servicing Analytics on Friday, we observed a significant workload reduction (35-42%)—considerably higher than the initial target of 20%.
The DS workload reduction strategy was initially deployed based on the previous logic from Servicing Analytics. We validated this logic and the associated accounts generated from October 1st, with confirmations from Servicing Analytics on October 11th and Staffing on October 18th. However, on October 30th, Dalton’s simulation results indicated that DS workload was higher than business as usual (BAU). We identified a mismatch in the starting point as the root cause, which Dalton helped address by sharing the updated logic to reconcile this on November 1st. The latest results, generated over the past two days, reflect this adjustment.
I recommend that the team revisits the starting point to ensure alignment with Staffing’s calculations. Given the new logic is resulting in workload reduction above the 20% target, DS will need some time to adjust our strategy accordingly. Assuming this new logic is correct, we expect to require 1-2 weeks to refine and validate the updated strategy through additional simulations.
Thank you for your collaboration.
Best regards,
