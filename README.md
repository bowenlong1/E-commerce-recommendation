Hi Quetzal,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to follow up again on my I-140 filing preparation. I appreciate your response last week and wanted to check in on the current status.

Given the immigration uncertainties, I’m hoping to file as soon as possible. I appreciate your understanding. Please let me know if there’s anything else needed from my side to help move the process forward.

Best regards,
Bowen
