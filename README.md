Hi Susan/Piyush,

Hope you are doing well. We have this scheduler job that run every morning, however, both Ateeb and myself have cleaned every files on SAS management console, can you please help with this issue. I am concerned if we just leave it alone, we may run into the scheduler issue what happened to Stella, Pual and myself previously, we kept receiving tons of emails every second and impact our daily work. 

I submitted a ticket for this RITM5987324, let me know if anything else needed. Appreciated your help
