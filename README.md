Hi Chris,

I wanted to follow up this ticket I submitted few days ago, is there any updates about the installation? My leadership require us have VS code installed and copilot by Friday, there some configuration I may also need to do after installation. I appreciate your time looking into this in timely manner. Let me know if you also want to hop on a call to discuss.
