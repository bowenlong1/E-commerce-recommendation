Collaborated with business, performed EDA, and used Random Forest to select top 80 features.
Tested multiple models and selected XGBoost as the baseline.
Optimized XGBoost with hyperparameters; validated using F1-score and ROC-AUC.
Selected top 30 features with SHAP for final deployment in Databricks
