Current strategy holdout only based on days past due, and more holdout on early delinquency, less holdout on late delinquency
Strategy proposal 1 & 2 holdout more on early delinquency and accounts that more likely to pay, while Strategy proposal 3 more holdout on late delinquency and accounts less likely to pay
Strategy proposal 1 doesnâ€™t holdout consider account deficiency balance while strategy 2 & 3 considered and more holdout on low deficiency
