Hey Iris,

I hope you’re doing great! I wanted to share some news with you—I’ve decided to resign from my role at GMF, and my last day will be this Friday.

I’m really grateful for the time I’ve had you as a mentor this year. Your advice and support have been so helpful and made my 5-year experience at GMF even more unforgettable and colorful. I truly appreciate it.

Next up, I’ll be moving to San Diego, and I’m excited for what’s ahead. Wishing you all the best, and let’s definitely keep in touch!

Best,
Bowen
