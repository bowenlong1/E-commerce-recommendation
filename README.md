Certainly! Here's a refined version of your message:

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to follow up on my reimbursement application (Application G-AppID278) which I submitted in 2021. To date, I have not received any updates regarding its status.

For context, I am currently pursuing a PhD in Data Sciences at Harrisburg University, an accredited institution. This course of study is directly relevant to my current job responsibilities. I'd also like to highlight that I have consistently maintained a 4.0 GPA throughout my academic journey.

Given the above, could you please provide an update on when I can expect to receive the reimbursement?

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Warm regards,

[Your Name]
