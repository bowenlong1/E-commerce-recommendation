Hi Ateeb,

I wanted to let you know personally that I submitted my resignation letter to Anna this morning—I didn’t want it to come as a surprise. I’ve truly enjoyed working with you over the years. My last day will be December 20, and I’ll do my best to ensure a smooth transfer of responsibilities.

Wishing you all the best moving forward!

Take care,
