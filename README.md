Data Science assessed contact strategies for 46-60 DPD accounts, aiming to optimize workload and performance. This involved a 3-day dialer holdout and two omni-channel strategies utilizing ML algorithms for payment propensity and equity risk assessment.

Overall:
•	The 3-day dialer holdout strategy showed higher 46DPD vintage movement to 61+DPD compared to data science strategies.
•	Minimal differences were observed in movement to 91/121+DPD or repo/skip charge-offs.
Segmentation Results:
•	High and medium propensity-to-pay groups with high equity risk saw fewer movements to 61/91/121+DPD & Charge-offs with data science strategies, suggesting increased Call Holdout.
•	In the medium propensity-to-pay group with low equity risk, data science strategies exhibited more movements to 61+DPD but fewer to 91/121+DPD & Charge-offs, indicating a similar Call Holdout schedule.
•	For the low propensity-to-pay group, data science strategies showed more movements to 61/91/121+DPD & Charge-offs, suggesting a potential decrease in the Call Holdout schedule.
