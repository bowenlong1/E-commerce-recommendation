Dear Michael/Allison,

Thank you again for your support in my NIW case. Please find attached my detailed responses addressing the following questions:

Why is promoting advancements in user experience nationally important? How does your work benefit the U.S.?
Why is reducing model degradation nationally important?
Are there any upcoming Intuit projects in the pipeline that could be nationally important?
As outlined in my response, I would like to clarify two key points:

Model Degradation

I did not intend to position "specifically through reducing model degradation" as a core part of my expertise. I mentioned it because it was one of my onboarding tasks when we first met.
However, it aligns with my primary claim: using AI/ML to improve operational efficiency by ensuring long-term AI reliability and automation.
User Experience (UX) in the Claim

Including "improving user experience" is optional.
Even if we focus solely on AI/ML for operational efficiency, my work at Intuit, GMF, and in my PhD research provides strong support.
Please review and let me know if you need any additional information. I truly appreciate your guidance and patience throughout this process.

Best regards,
Bowen
