Wei is an exceptional manager, known for his warmth and friendliness. He genuinely cares about the well-being of his team and demonstrates outstanding leadership qualities. Beyond effectively managing tasks and ensuring their completion, Wei actively fosters the professional growth of his team members. He goes beyond the routine tasks, engaging them in projects that contribute to their development. Personally, he has encouraged and provided me with opportunities to present and participate in leadership meetings, which significantly enhanced my soft skills. Moreover, Wei's technical prowess is commendable. He guided me through various challenging experiments, introducing me to advanced techniques such as difference in difference and propensity matching. Despite their complexity, he adeptly explains these concepts and leads the experiments to successful completion. Additionally, Wei is a versatile leader who continuously strives for self-improvement. His dedication to refining his presentation and communication skills, as well as his ability to influence senior leadership, is evident. Overall, working under Wei's guidance has been a rewarding experience, and I have witnessed firsthand his commitment to both the team's success and individual growth.



Wei is a very nice and friendly manager, which is greatly appreciated. In interactions with senior leadership, there may be moments where a more assertive stance could be beneficial in effectively conveying ideas. I believe it would benefit him to assert his opinions even more in such situations. Nevertheless, I've noticed his ongoing growth in influencing and persuading others, which is truly commendable.
