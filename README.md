Hello, 

I recently completed the ‘Statying Thoughtful’ corporate challenge and submitted my biometric results. I just wanted to check in whether any other activities I need to complete to earn any eligible reductions? Also I think previously, there is tobacco affidavit form, seems not available this year?

Thank you,
Bowen
