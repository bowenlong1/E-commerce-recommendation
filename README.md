from this table MART_FINC.FINCL_TRANSACT_ITM_FACT you shared with me, I know the waive amount for each fee type, but can I know from anywhere what's the original total fee for each type within the account payoff amountï¼Ÿbasically any data source show account payoff amount breakdown by fee types?


Also, does waive means clear this fee to $0? for example, customer A has $100 waive for "LATE CHARGES FEE", so what's the original total fee for 'LATE CHARGES' or $100 is actually the total.
