Hello,

I recently completed the ‘Staying Thoughtful’ corporate challenge and submitted my biometric results. I wanted to check if there are any other activities I need to complete to qualify for any eligible reductions. I also noticed that the tobacco affidavit form, which was available in previous years, doesn't seem to be offered this year. Is that correct?

Thank you,
Bowen
