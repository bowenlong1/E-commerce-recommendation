Thank you, Yesenia, for providing such valuable information! I indeed have several research projects that I believe align with national interests. As you may be aware, I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Data Sciences while working full-time, with an expected completion date next April. My doctoral research primarily focuses on utilizing data science techniques to enhance the efficiency and outcomes of public healthcare in the United States.

For instance, one of my most highly cited papers (with 15 citations) titled "Forecasting the Monkeypox Outbreak Using ARIMA, Prophet, NeuralProphet, and LSTM Models in the United States" introduces a forecasting tool empowering health experts to implement effective prevention policies against Monkeypox outbreaks.

As per usavisanow.com, attorneys have identified researchers with at least five publications and ten citations as having established themselves as authority figures, possessing sufficient evidence to demonstrate their capability to advance proposed endeavors for the NIW visa. I am pleased to share that my current figures meet and exceed this threshold.

For your reference, here is the link to my publications so far, and I anticipate having a few more papers published soon: [link]

Once again, thank you for your guidance, and please let me know if you require any further information or clarification.
