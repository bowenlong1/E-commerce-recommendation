Expect EOT portfolio and EOT workable accounts increase when the market returns to normal, we aim to develop an alternative collection strategy that reduce % of workload and thus handle increased workable accounts within existing FTEs
By targeting 20% workload reduction, we expect to manage 125% EOT workable accounts increase, then we expect to handle 3.75k ~ 6.25k workable accounts per day
By targeting 50% workload reduction, we expect to manage 200% EOT workable accounts increase, then we expect to handle 6k ~ 10K workable accounts per day

**Within existing call schedule, it’s expected to hangle 3k ~ 5k workable accounts. Assuming leveraging full capacity of FTEs currently available, which is 63 FTEs and 40 accounts per account, it’s expected to handle 5k workable accounts.
