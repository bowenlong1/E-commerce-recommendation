Hi Sebastian,

Here is update data pipeline for 2nd iteration based on the reconciliation code you shared. There are just few changes, I highlighted in the screenshot below.

1.	add ‘RD’ accounts filter to extension
 
2.	Add two more variables – month and monthday to samp3 dataset 
Everything else stay the same, pleaset me know any questions.
