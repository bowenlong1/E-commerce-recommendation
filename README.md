Hi Eder,

Thanks for following up. I plan to move after last day with my current employer. I plan to give 2-week notice after receiving H1-B approval, if all those can be finished by end of December 2024, I should be in san diego before the start date 1/6/2024.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Bowen
