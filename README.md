Hi Quetzal,

Thank you very much for providing the draft letter! I have shared it with the person at Citi who gave me the initial signature and ask for a new signature. I should be able to give you the new letter early next week.

Also, I will be travelling to China for 3 weeks from Apr 22 to May 10, is there anything I need to pay attention to regarding my immigration status? I am currently on H1B and has PERM pending. And I got H1b stamp last year in Beijing China it will be valid unitll August 2024.

Thanks,
Bowen
