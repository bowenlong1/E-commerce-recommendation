Note: 
*Model training using year 2019 and 06/2022 to 06/2023 data, while year 2019 doesn’t have property tax information
**Based on data from 11/16/2023 to 12/06/2023, daily average called EOT accounts at 1-90DPD for Non-property tax only accounts is 1,154. for tax only accounts it’s only about 117 
. Also Expect a further percentage decrease in Property Tax Only accounts as the market normalizes, making Non-Property Tax Only accounts the primary focus
