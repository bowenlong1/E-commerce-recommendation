Hi Fiza,

I wanted to let you know personally that I submitted my resignation letter to Anna this morning—I didn’t want it to come as a surprise. I’ve truly enjoyed working with you over the years, even though we’ve had the occasional disagreement on projects (haha).

My last day will be December 20, and I’ll do my best to ensure a smooth transfer of responsibilities. Wishing you all the best moving forward!

Take care,
