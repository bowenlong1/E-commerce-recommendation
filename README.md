Hi Chris,

I wanted to follow up on the ticket I submitted a few days ago. Are there any updates about the installation? My leadership requires us to have VS Code installed along with Copilot by Friday. There may be some configurations I also need to set up after installation. I appreciate your timely attention to this matter. Let me know if you would like to hop on a call to discuss further.

Thank you,
