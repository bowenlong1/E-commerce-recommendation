Good morning Pramod/Ashish,

Following our discussion in this morning's meeting, it appears that I may have lost access to the SAS container under gmfcusproddpmlandingsa (ADLS Gen2). This access is essential for uploading flat files required for the ongoing experiment.

Attached is a screenshot depicting the current access I possess. Could you kindly assist me in resolving this access issue at your earliest convenience?

Your prompt attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.

Warm regards,
