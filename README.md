Hi Iris,
I am so glad we are matched and you becoming my mentor! A brief introduction about myself, I am currently working as a senior data scientist at data science department, my focus is on utilizing algorithms and programming tools to develop dialer, email, push notification strategies for collection team to improve collection effectiveness on delinquent customers. I have been with GMF for about 4 years, I want to leverage this mentorship opportunity to further my softkills including communication, leadership, presentation etc. 

On the personal side, I am originally from China, I came to the US in 2016 to purse my master degree, after graduated in 2018, I have been working in the US since then. In my spare time, I like playing sports such as basketable, tennis and socialize with friends. I also like doing research, so I am pursing a data sciences phd while working full time.

I am looking forward the mentor journey adhead, would you like me to schedule a introduction meeting this or next week to learn more about each and discuss our mentorship plan? Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,
Bowen
