Hey Iris!

I have my dissertation defense scheduled for Wednesday at 2 PM EST, on March 27th. I would like to invite you to my defense meeting! I have shared your email with my school, so you might receive a Teams meeting invite soon. I am looking forward to seeing you here. However, I understand you are busy, so it's okay if you can't make it.
