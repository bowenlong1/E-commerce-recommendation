5a: This really only applies if there is a due segment on the account. This date indicates the latest due segment satisfied. Keep in mind that pre-termination, loans and leases work differently here… on a loan you are paying in arrears, so the “paid-to date” on a current account could easily be in the past (usually less than 30 days). However, on a lease you are paying in advance, so the paid-to date on a current lease should normally be in the future. 

On EOT accounts, it works similarly but different. When the account finalizes, a single paid-to date is established for a date 20 days after the finalization date. If the account is paid off during that time, the paid-to date is changed to 99991231. If the account is not paid in full by that date, it will begin aging. If the account has a payment plan established, the due dates for the payment plan will determine the paid-to dates and the account will age appropriately, based on whether or not the payments are made. The one caveat… subsequent billings will not reset these paid-to dates, so if an account is paid in full and goes to 99991231 and then a thrubill posts to the account to create a balance, the paid-to date will stay at 99991231 unless a payment plan is created.
