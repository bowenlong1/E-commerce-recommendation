Hi Amy/Anna,

We observed some differences in DS request holdout percentages over the three days analyzed. Specifically, the portfolio day key 20241120 showed the highest request percentage, followed by 20241201, with 20241117 having the lowest. Please see the details below:

Workload Date	Portfolio Day Key	DS Total Accounts	DS Request Holdout	DS Request Holdout %
11/19/2024	20241117	1426	844	59.2%
11/22/2024	20241120	1318	898	68.1%
12/3/2024	20241201	1433	911	63.6%
We believe part of this difference is due to portfolio shifts. Below is the portfolio distribution across the three days for Test 1 and Test 2.

For Test 1, which targets more holdouts on customers with lower days past due and a higher likelihood of payment, we observed a higher concentration of good customers on 20241120, contributing to the higher holdout percentage.

For Test 2, which targets more holdouts on customers with higher days past due and a lower likelihood of payment, we also observed a higher concentration of bad customers on 20241120, which similarly contributed to the increased holdout percentage.

Collectively, this suggests that the higher DS request percentage on 20241120 compared to the other two dates can be attributed to these portfolio shifts.

Below is a recap of the two strategy proposals for reference:

Strategy Proposal 1 (Test 1): Targets holdouts more on customers with lower days past due and a higher likelihood of payment.
Strategy Proposal 2 (Test 2): Targets holdouts more on customers with higher days past due and a lower likelihood of payment.
Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!

Best regards,
