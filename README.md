Hi Iris,

I'm delighted that we've been matched, and I'm thrilled to have you as my mentor! Here's a brief introduction about myself: I currently serve as a Senior Data Scientist in the Data Science Department, where I focus on utilizing algorithms and programming tools to develop dialer, email, and push notification strategies for the collection team, aiming to enhance the effectiveness of collections on delinquent customers. I've been with GMF for about four years, and I see this mentorship as an excellent opportunity to develop my soft skills, including communication, leadership, and presentation.

On a personal note, I'm originally from China and came to the US in 2016 to pursue my master's degree. After graduating in 2018, I've been working in the US ever since. In my spare time, I enjoy playing sports such as basketball and tennis and socializing with friends. Additionally, I have a passion for research, which is why I'm pursuing a Ph.D. in Data Sciences while working full-time.

I'm eagerly looking forward to the mentorship journey ahead. Would you be available for an introductory meeting this or next week to get to know each other better and discuss our mentorship plan?

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,
Bowen
