Hi Sebastian,

I've made updates to the data pipeline for the 2nd iteration based on the reconciliation code you provided. There are just a few changes, which I've highlighted in the screenshot below.

Added an 'RD' accounts filter to the extension.
Included two additional variables - 'month' and 'monthday' - in the samp3 dataset.
Everything else remains unchanged. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
