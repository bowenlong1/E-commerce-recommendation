Thank you Dalton for sharing the latest results. After adding the property tax only and 14-day payment filters as we previously discussed to increase the requested DS holdout, we still observe that the reflected DS holdout in workload accounts is 455, which remains lower than the BAU holdout at 738 and doesnâ€™t seem to yield much improvement. It may be helpful to prioritize reconciling the starting point logic shared by Servicing Analytics earlier. Please let us know if you need any support from the DS as you compare accounts and reconcile the logic.
