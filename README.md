Hi Quetzal,

Thanks for the update. I don’t have other letters. Regarding the second requirement “identification of business issues”, I think second point from my Citi letter covered event though it’s not use exact same language. For the uncovered points from the first requirement, my understanding they are examples of ‘applied methodologies’, as long as the fourth point from my citi letter covered 'applied methologies’ I think it should be fine? Or do we need use exact same language from letters as PERM requirements and cover every examples? If that’s the case, I can refine the Citi letter and get the signature, will that work?
