Current Strategy
Currently for 1-90DPD EOT accounts, dialer and manual calls are separated:
Dialer calls:
1-14 DPD: Excluded from dialer calls
15-60 DPD: Holdout one day after every two days of call
61-80 DPD: Called every day
81-90 DPD: Selected days to call (83, 85, 86, 88, 90DPD)
Manual calls:
No holdout strategy except for accounts with promise hold and/or courtesy hold*
Almost all calls will be moving to dialer
