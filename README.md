Hi Dr. Huggins, thank you so much for the comments! This dissertation will be application/project based, which is one alternative way for dissertation as suggested by Dr. Ford. I discussed with Dr.Purcell, he is agreed with this approach. So all 3 published studies try to showcase the applications utilizing machine learning to enhance healthcare efficiency, which is the common theme of all 3 projects. I indeed emphasize the commonalities of these 3 projects in section 3 from framework standpoint, for example all of them are comparative study and utilized comprehensive modeling techniques and then select the best one to apply. Since all studies are published, based on current content for dissertation, do you have any thing you would like me to incorporate to further strengthen the connections among 3 papers? I will try my best to incorporate.
