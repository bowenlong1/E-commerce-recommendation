"Hi Sophie,

Attached is the file Dalton shared with us for QA testing. Based on this file, we were able to generate the routing summary table below. It would be great if Dalton could share the same file with us every day for production checks. Otherwise, we will need to send Dalton all the accounts with unexpected routing, and he will manually check them for us, as we did during the experiment.

Best regards,
