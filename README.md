Dalton and I discussed the simulation results, and we still have concerns about the starting point regarding the workable accounts that DS can touch. Currently, we are starting from the workable accounts based on the logic shared and validated by Servicing Analytics (as attached), which gave us 989 accounts as of the workload date 10/30. On top of these 989 accounts, after applying DS’s strategy, we are holding out 80%—789 accounts.

While we could increase this holdout percentage further, say to 90%, the staffing workload of 1,463 accounts is based on a different logic than the one DS is using to create its strategy. This raises concerns about how the requested 90% holdout will actually be reflected in the staffing workload.

Therefore, unless DS receives consistent logic that generates the staffing workload (1,463 accounts) and applies the strategy accordingly, there will still be concerns regarding how the workload reduction will be reflected in practice.
