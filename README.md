Dalton and I discussed the simulation results, for DS, we still have concerns about the staring point regarding the workable accounts that DS can touch. Currently we starting from workable accounts based on logic shared by servicing analytics (as attached), it gave us 989 accounts (workload date 10/30), and on top of this 989 accounts, applying DS strategy, we are holding out 80% already â€“ 789 accounts. even though we can still increase this percentage further e,g, 90%, however, the staffing workload accounts (1,463) is based on different logic, which is different from the logic that DS using to create strategy. So we have concerns how this assuming 90% requested holdout percentage will actually reflected in staffing workload. so unless DS receive consistent logic that generate staffing workload (1,463 accounts) and apply the strategy over here, there would be still concern and actual workload reduction.
