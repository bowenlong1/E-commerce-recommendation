Key steps:
1.	Collected latest 1 year of customer data and collected more than 300+ variables and created the payment labels in the next 7 days
2.	Worked closely with business to understand feature meanings, did EDA and feature selction, feature selection, and build a random forest model to select top 80 variables for baseline modeling
3.	Tried logistic regression, decision trees, ensemble tree models such as xgboost, light gbm etc and determined xgboost as baseline model
4.	Optimized xgboost throough additional hyperparamters, features, cross-validated model performance based on F1-score, roc-auc value, until finalze
5.	Use shap value and selted top 30 variables for final model deploy in databricks
